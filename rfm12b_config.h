  The RFM12b has a FFOV (rx register overflow) and an RGUR (tx register
  underflow) field in the status word. Those should be set if there was
  an overflow of data while receiving (e.g. you're not reading data fast
  enough) or if you don't supply bits to be sent fast enough, respectively.
  
  However, I'm not sure if I understand those fields correctly, as disregarding
  them seems to improve reliability a lot â€“ I need to investigate this further.
  Thus, you can enable/disable the behavior to regard a send/recv as failed
  when these bits are set in the status register.
  
  Note that even if the "drop packet" behavior is disabled, you are still
  protected against corrupted data by the internal CRC16 checksum.
  
  Tip: Leave these at defaults, unless you're actively investigating this.
